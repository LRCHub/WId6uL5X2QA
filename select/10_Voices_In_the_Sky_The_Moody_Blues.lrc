[00:18.03] Bluebird, flying high
[00:19.99] Tell me what you sing
[00:21.78] If you could talk to me
[00:25.47] What news would you bring
[00:29.05] Of voices in the sky
[00:39.05] 
[00:37.20] Nightingale, hovering high
[00:40.83] Harmonize the wind
[00:45.44] Darkness, your symphony
[00:49.06] I can hear you sing
[00:52.69] Of voices in the sky
[01:02.69] 
[01:00.88] Just what is happening to me
[01:04.40] I lie awake with the sound of the sea
[01:08.09] Calling to me
[01:14.59] 
[01:23.46] Old man, passing by
[01:27.04] Tell me what you sing
[01:30.69] Though your voice be faint
[01:34.29] I am listening
[01:37.83] Voices in the sky
[01:46.33] 
[01:45.90] Children with a skipping rope
[01:49.56] Tell me what you sing
[01:54.19] Play time is nearly gone
[01:57.77] The bell's about to ring
[02:01.39] Voices in the sky
[02:09.89] 
[02:09.54] Just what is happening to me
[02:13.10] I lie awake with the sound of the sea
[02:16.72] Calling to me
[02:23.22] 
[02:32.09] Bluebird, flying high
[02:35.61] Tell me what you sing
[02:39.22] If you could talk to me
[02:42.91] What news would you bring
[02:47.53] Of voices in the sky
[02:54.75] Voices in the sky
[03:02.00] Voices in the sky
[03:10.22] Voices in the sky
