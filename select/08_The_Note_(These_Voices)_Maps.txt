Don't think I've been in love
And don't intend to be
But sitting here right now's
The closest thing for me

I won't be here much longer
The way it has to be
Promise me you'll carry on
You'll always feel this

Energy
That symmetry
That won't just leave you

These voices they keep calling me
One day they'll have there way with me
My girl, this new world
Will never leave you

Don't think I've been in love
And don't intend to be
But sitting here right now's
The cloest thing for me

I won't be here much longer
The way it has to be
Promise me you'll carry on
You'll always feel this

Energy
That symmetry
That won't just leave you

These voices they keep calling me
One day they'll have there way with me
My girl, this new world
Will never leave you
