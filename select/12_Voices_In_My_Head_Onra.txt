I don't think that I've gone to far
A little bit wild I know
(Little bit wild I know)
Pull your strings like a cheap guitar
Cus Baby I'm in control
(Baby I'm in control)

You feel it coming
You
Feel it
In your
Bones

Release your monster

I love the voices in my head
You think I'm running off the edge
You wanna fix me
But maybe I like me Broken
I love my life cus it's a mess
I'm living for the Craziness
You wanna fix me
But maybe I like me broken

Make me into your Fantasy
But this is a horror show
(This is a horror show)
Games you play they don't work on me
Cus I got
Tricks of
My own
(I got tricks of my own)

You feel it coming
You
Feel it
In your
Bones

Release your monster

I love the voices in my head
You think I'm running off the edge
You wanna fix me
But maybe I like me broken
I love my life cus it's a mess
I'm living for the craziness
You wanna fix me
But maybe I like me broken

(Maybe I like me broken)
(Maybe I like me broken)

You wanna fix me
But maybe I like me broken

(Maybe I like me broken)
(Maybe I like me broken)

You wanna fix me
But maybe I like me broken
(Maybe I like me broken)

Maybe there's crazy in my Blood
But I don't care

I love the voices in my head
You think I'm running off the edge
You wanna fix me
But maybe I like me broken
I love my life cus it's a mess
I'm living for the craziness
You wanna fix me
But maybe I like me broken

(Maybe I like me broken)
(Maybe I like me broken)

You wanna fix me
But maybe I like me broken

(Maybe I like me broken)
(Maybe I like me broken)

You wanna fix me
But maybe I like me broken
