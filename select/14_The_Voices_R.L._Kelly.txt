I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Will I always live inside this zoo
When I think I'm done
But I haven't even tried to realize who I am when I'm alive

Ask the voice in my head
Am I ok

I can hear the voices getting louder
Why can't I turn em off, they're getting louder
Then I think they're gone but I haven't even tried to realize that they've eaten me alive

Ask the voice in my head
Am I ok?

She says get out of my head
