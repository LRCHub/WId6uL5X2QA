Full of voices
My head breaks down
My head bursts in you
Full of gestures
My face breaks down
My face bursts in you
On some blue, light-green fields
On a long, leaking road
I confess there's no course
That could lead me to you
Pictures of her
In those booklets
Crawling in my head
Trolleys, madness
Songs of coastguards
Can't relieve my speed
